Monitoring weather in survival situations is vital for making informed decisions about shelter, travel, and resource use. Begin by observing the environment. Changes in temperature, wind direction, and cloud formations can indicate approaching weather shifts. Pay close attention to your surroundings, as nature often provides clues to impending conditions.

In clear weather, monitor the horizon for cloud development. Wispy cirrus clouds high in the sky may indicate a change in weather within 24–48 hours, often signaling rain or storms. If cumulus clouds grow larger and darker, prepare for thunderstorms. Maintain a habit of checking the sky regularly, as changes can happen quickly.

Rainy weather demands vigilance. Observe how the rain starts—light, intermittent rain often precedes prolonged showers, while sudden, heavy rain may indicate brief storms. Note the wind patterns, as strong gusts or changes in direction can precede severe weather. Use natural shelters or waterproof gear to stay dry and avoid hypothermia.

Wind direction and strength are critical indicators. Sudden shifts in wind or escalating gusts often signify approaching storms or fronts. If you’re in open terrain, monitor flags, grass, or smoke for wind direction changes. Strong, consistent winds often accompany cold fronts, so prepare for drops in temperature.

Cloud formations play a crucial role in weather prediction. Puffy cumulus clouds usually indicate fair weather, while tall cumulonimbus clouds suggest thunderstorms. Gray, layered stratus clouds typically bring overcast skies and steady rain. Pay attention to the speed and direction of clouds, as faster-moving clouds can mean an approaching front.

In snowy environments, weather monitoring becomes crucial to avoid whiteouts or blizzards. Sudden temperature drops, increased wind speed, and a thickening haze in the distance may signal snowstorms. Notice if snow begins falling more densely or if visibility diminishes, as these are early warning signs.

Humidity and pressure changes are subtle yet essential indicators. Increased humidity often signals rain, while drops in pressure, felt as a "heaviness" in the air, usually precede storms. If you have access to a barometer or can sense pressure changes, use this information to anticipate weather shifts.

Nature itself offers valuable insights. Birds often fly lower before storms due to air pressure changes, and insects may become more active. Frogs and crickets tend to grow louder before rain. Watch animal behavior for signs of unease or movement toward shelter.

Nighttime monitoring is also important. Clear skies with visible stars often signal stable weather, but if the night air becomes humid or dew forms rapidly, expect possible morning fog or rain. A halo around the moon may indicate moisture in the atmosphere, often preceding rain.

Finally, continuous observation is key. Keep a journal of weather patterns if you’re in a survival situation for an extended period. Track changes in temperature, wind, and sky conditions to identify trends. Being proactive about monitoring the weather allows you to stay ahead of potential dangers and adapt to evolving conditions.
